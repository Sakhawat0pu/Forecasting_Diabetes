# Forecasting_Diabetes

The objective of this data science project is to employ machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes. By developing a model that can aid medical practitioners in identifying individuals who are at a greater risk of developing diabetes, the project aims to enable early intervention and improve diabetes management.
